# TmxLoader
Tmx File (Tiled Map Editor's Map file) Loader based on Tinyxml2.

## Feature
 - Read TMX and TSX. (currently supports version 1.1 - https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format)
 - Hardly depending on STL.

## Usage
Clone this repository and add source files in your project.
Then, just include "TmxLoader.h".

(This project does not include CMake Files or Makefiles,
so please configure your own build environment by yourself.)

TmxLoader::ParseTMX() returns TmxLoader::Map, which contains all data.
